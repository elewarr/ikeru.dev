## About Me

I'm Krystian Lewandowski — a software developer with over 20 years of commercial experience, specializing in system-level and cross-platform development. I work across mobile ecosystems, embedded platforms, and kernel-level systems, and I enjoy driving complex projects from architecture through to full delivery.

Throughout my career I've had the privilege of working on a wide range of cutting-edge projects for major technology and mobile service providers — from building an AirPlay server prototype on Android, to contributing kernel drivers accepted into the official OpenBSD tree, to designing secure payment encoding libraries for custom hardware.
